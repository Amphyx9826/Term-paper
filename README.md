Abstract:  

Glacial systems and ice caps are melting in response to global warming and climate change. The physical causes and its relation to glacial melting have been studied extensively, but the icy environments are thought to be less biological diverse and the role of biological processes that takes place on the surface of glaciers and ice has been neglected in the radiative forcing balance models. In recent years field observations and lab experiments have shown how large bio-cover (termed as supraglacial environment)  can be and their role in changing surface reflectivity which ultimately contributes to melting, hence starting a positive feedback loop. Furthermore, cyanobacteria and algae capture CO2 in this environment and convert it into organic matter, when they die they are broken down by microbes in the form of carbonic acid and other biomolecules and are flushed by water during melting season causing increased weathering.  Here in this paper, the correlation between algal abundance and reduction of albedo has been analyzed graphically from the data based on the recent research.
